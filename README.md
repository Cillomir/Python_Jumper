# PythonProjects
A collection of files and projects written in Python code

The first project uploaded is my first fully useable python program. It is a game designed as a basic clone of Mario. 
Up to two players can play using the same keyboard. A player tries to jump upon the randomly generated goobers. Each
goober has an associated amount of points. When a player collides with a goober they did not jump on, the player loses
one life and resets position. After losing all three lives the game ends and allows the player to return to the main
menu. 

This project allowed me to test several different functionalities as I learned how to code in Python. I used the Pygame
GUI to assist in generating and tracking sprites as well as create the main screens. All the images are my own original
pixel art except the backdrop images and the PlayerNinja sprite, which were each drawn from open license sources on
OpenGameArt.org. Music and soundeffects were also drawn from open license sources on OpenGameArt.org. These are used
with permission as per their Creative Commons licensing agreement for personal, not commercial, usage.
